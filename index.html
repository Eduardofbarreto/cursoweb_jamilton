                content of a page when looking at its layout. 
                The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a 
                more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as 
                opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
                making it look like readable English. Many desktop 
                publishing packages and web page editors now use 
                Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a 
                search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
                sites still in their infancy. 
                Various versions have evolved over the years, s
                ometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
